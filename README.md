I utilized the blade template that the HR department sent, along with PHP 8.1 and Laravel 10 for this project.
1. After downloading the project, execute composer install commend. 
2. Execute the PHP Artistry Migration.
3. launch php artisan seed db. The states and cities from the seeder will be added by seed to the database, and that will then appear in the dropdown on the user registration page. 
4. After logging in and registering, you'll be taken to Dashbord, where you can add categories using the category modal 
I created a resource folder called tasks, and inside it are three files: create, form, and edit. I'll use the same form file for both edit and make tasks 
6. Once tasks are added, they can be filtered by category or name. 
7. We can also implement the functionality of selecting and deleting jobs using AJAX. 
8. The custome.js file, which is part of the public/js directory, houses all of the jQuery functionality. 
9. In order to export Excel for this working, I used maatwebsite/excel.
